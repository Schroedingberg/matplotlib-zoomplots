*  matplotlib-zoomplots
A library for easy access of the zoom functions from the matplotlib [[http://matplotlib.org/examples/pylab_examples/axes_zoom_effect.html][gallery]]


For now, this is just for my personal use for some spectroscopic data analysis.
However, on long term I would like to make this a bigger library that is so
easy to use, that also non-programming scientists can use it.
